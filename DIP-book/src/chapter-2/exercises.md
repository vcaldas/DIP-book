# 2.1 - Determine the actual phyical measurements in milimeters of an image with 1400 rectangular pixels and resolution of 72dpi.

72 dots per inch

1 inch = 25.4 mm


So, 1400/72 = 19.44 inches

19.44 * 25.4 = 492.76 mm

# 2.2  - A camera with a focal length of f = 50 mm is used to take a photo of a vertical collumn of 12m high and 95 m away frin tge caera, Determine its height ib the image in mm and the number of pixels assuming the camera has a 4000dpi.


direct application of formulas

y = -f Y/Z

f = 50 mm
Y = 12000 mm
Z = 95000

y = - 50 10^-3 * 12.000/95000
y = 6.3157 * 10^(-3) ~ 6.3 mm height of the tree in the image

6.3mm ~0.25 inches
1 inch = 4000
0.25 = 1000 pixels //


# 2.3 - The image sensor of a certai digital camera contains 2016 x 3024 pixels. the geometry of this sensor is identical to that of a traditional 35mm camera (with an image size of 24 x 36 mm) except that it is 1.6 times smaller (cropped sensor). Compute the resolution of this digital sensor in dots per inch (dpi).


 35mm sensors are what we call "full-frame" in digital photography and the 1.6x smaller are cropped sensors.

 Real dimensions of the sensor = > 24/1.6 = 15mm  and 36/1.6 = 22.5 mm.

 15mm ~ 0.6 inches
 22.5 mm ~ 0.885 inches

 2016/0.6 = 3024/0.885 ~3360 dpi.

 # 2.4 - Assume the camera geometry is the same described in 2.23 combined with a lens with focal length f = 50mm. What blurring (in pixes) woud be caused by univorm 0.1o horizontal turn of the camera during exposure? Recompute this for f = 300 mm. Decide if the exten of the blurring also depends on the distance of the object.
